<h1 class="title">Swiss Table Tennis Elo Rating Simulation</h1>
</header>
<h1 id="project-overview-conceptual-brief-draft">Project Overview –
Conceptual Brief (draft)</h1>
<h2 id="context-and-motivation">Context and Motivation</h2>
<p>In Swiss table tennis, each competitive player is assigned a
numerical rating called Elo. This rating can be thought of as a point
score that represents a player’s competitive strength.</p>
<ul>
<li>A player with more Elo points is considered stronger than a player
with fewer points.</li>
<li>The difference in Elo points between two players reflects how likely
one player is to win against the other.</li>
<li>When a player wins or loses a match, their Elo score changes
according to a predefined rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this sense, the Elo system creates a ranking hierarchy: players
are ordered by Elo points, and these points evolve over time as matches
are played.</p>
<p>While the Elo update rule is deterministic once a match result is
known, real competition is inherently uncertain. Players face different
opponents, match outcomes fluctuate, and a single month of competition
can lead to very different ranking trajectories.</p>
<p>As a competitive player, I am not interested in predicting a single
“most likely” future Elo value. Instead, I want to understand the range
of plausible outcomes:</p>
<p><strong>How much could my Elo realistically increase or decrease over
a typical month of competition?</strong></p>
<h2 id="core-idea-of-the-project">Core Idea of the Project</h2>
<p>The key idea of the project is to treat a month of competition as a
random experiment rather than a fixed trajectory.</p>
<p>Instead of asking: &gt; “What will my Elo be next month?”</p>
<p>the project asks: &gt; “If this month were replayed many times under
realistic conditions, what distribution of Elo outcomes would we
observe?”</p>
<p>To answer this question, the project uses <strong>Monte Carlo
simulation</strong>: the same month is simulated thousands of times,
each time with different random match outcomes. This produces a
distribution of final Elo points, rather than a single predicted
value.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-being-simulated">What Is Being Simulated</h2>
<p>The project simulates the evolution of a competitive player’s Elo
rating over a single month of competition, treating this month as a
probabilistic experiment rather than a deterministic sequence of
events.</p>
<p>At a high level, each simulated month follows the same logical
pipeline:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A monthly competition structure is defined, consisting of league
matches and a tournament.</li>
<li>For each match in the month, an opponent is selected according to
institutional rules (league rosters or tournament pools).</li>
<li>A probability of winning is assigned to the match.</li>
<li>A win or loss outcome is randomly drawn based on this
probability.</li>
<li>Elo points are updated using the official Swiss Elo update
system.</li>
<li>The entire month is repeated many times using Monte Carlo simulation
to generate a distribution of possible end-of-month Elo outcomes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal is not to predict a single future Elo value, but to observe
how Elo outcomes vary across many plausible realizations of the same
competitive month.</p>
<p>All detailed modeling assumptions (competition format, opponent
sampling rules, probability models, and parameter values) are specified
explicitly in the Modeling Choices &amp; Hypotheses section.</p>
<h2 id="why-monte-carlo-simulation-is-used">Why Monte Carlo Simulation
Is Used</h2>
<p>A single month of competition is subject to substantial randomness:
match outcomes are uncertain, opponents vary in strength, and small
differences in results can lead to different ranking trajectories.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo simulation addresses this uncertainty by replaying the
same month thousands of times, each time with different random outcomes.
This produces an <strong>empirical distribution</strong> of final Elo
values, rather than a single point estimate.</p>
<p>This distribution-based perspective allows us to quantify: - expected
Elo change, - downside and upside risk, - and the overall variability of
ranking outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="role-of-win-probability-modeling">Role of Win Probability
Modeling</h2>
<p>A key component of the simulation is the assignment of winning
probabilities to individual matches.</p>
<p>The project deliberately distinguishes between: - the simulation of
match outcomes, and - the update of Elo points, which always follows the
official Swiss system.</p>
<p>Two alternative models are used to generate match outcomes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Official Elo-based probabilities</strong>, derived directly
from the Swiss Elo formula.</li>
<li><strong>Machine-learning-based probabilities</strong>, learned
empirically from historical match data involving many players.</li>
</ol>
<p>Importantly, these two models differ only in how match outcomes are
generated. All Elo point updates are computed using the same official
Swiss Elo update rule, ensuring that the ranking evolution remains
realistic and comparable across scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-compared-across-simulations">What Is Compared Across
Simulations</h2>
<p>The simulation is run separately under each probability model, while
holding all other elements constant.</p>
<p>The comparison focuses on: - how the distribution of monthly Elo
outcomes changes, - whether dispersion, skewness, or tail risk differs,
- and how sensitive ranking uncertainty is to probability modeling
assumptions.</p>
<p>The project does not aim to declare one probability model “better”
than the other in an absolute sense. Instead, it evaluates how different
modeling choices translate into different uncertainty profiles for
ranking evolution.</p>
<h2 id="output-of-the-project">Output of the Project</h2>
<p>The final outputs of the simulation are: - distributions of
end-of-month Elo values, - summary statistics (mean, quantiles), - and
visual comparisons between scenarios.</p>
<p>These outputs form the basis for interpretation, discussion of
limitations, and potential extensions.</p>
<h2 id="transition-to-modeling-choices-hypotheses">Transition to
Modeling Choices &amp; Hypotheses</h2>
<p>The remainder of the project formalizes the elements described
above.</p>
<p>In particular, the Modeling Choices &amp; Hypotheses section
specifies: - the exact structure of a competitive month, - opponent
sampling rules, - win probability models, - and the Elo update
mechanism.</p>
<p>The code implementation is expected to follow these specifications
exactly, without introducing additional assumptions.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="research-question">Research Question</h1>
<p><strong>How uncertain is the short-term evolution of a Swiss table
tennis player’s Elo ranking over a typical month of competition, and how
sensitive is this uncertainty to the choice of win-probability model
(official Elo-based probabilities versus a data-driven machine learning
alternative)?</strong></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="modeling-choices-and-hypotheses">Modeling Choices and
Hypotheses</h1>
<h2 id="scope-and-objective-of-the-model">Scope and Objective of the
Model</h2>
<p>The objective of the model is not to predict a single future Elo
rating, but to characterize the <strong>distribution of plausible
short-term ranking outcomes</strong> for a Swiss table tennis
player.</p>
<p>The model therefore focuses on uncertainty and variability, rather
than point forecasts.</p>
<p>The analysis is restricted to a short-term horizon of one typical
month of competition, which allows the model to remain interpretable
while capturing the main sources of randomness affecting ranking
evolution.</p>
<h2 id="structural-assumptions-on-competition-format">Structural
Assumptions on Competition Format</h2>
<p>A month of competition is modeled as a fixed and stylized sequence of
competitive events, designed to approximate a realistic competitive
workload rather than replicating exact institutional formats.</p>
<p>The player is assumed to participate in: - <strong>two league
encounters</strong>, each consisting of three individual one-on-one
matches, and - <strong>one national tournament</strong>.</p>
<p>To ensure a consistent number of matches across simulated months, the
tournament is modeled using a hypothetical placement-based structure
that guarantees a fixed workload. Specifically, the tournament is
assumed to involve a group stage of three matches, followed by four
additional placement matches, yielding a total of seven tournament
matches.</p>
<p>This structure does not reflect the standard Swiss tournament system,
where early elimination may reduce the number of matches played.
Instead, it is introduced as a modeling device to approximate the
intensity of competition over a month while maintaining tractability and
comparability across Monte Carlo simulations. The implications of this
simplification are discussed in the limitations section.</p>
<h2 id="match-outcome-assumptions">Match Outcome Assumptions</h2>
<p>Each match outcome is modeled as a binary random variable (win or
loss).</p>
<ul>
<li>Match scores, set differences, and margin of victory are not
considered.</li>
<li>The effect of these omitted variables is implicitly absorbed into
the win probability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Match outcomes are assumed to be conditionally independent given the
win probabilities, meaning that any dependence between matches operates
only through changes in the player’s Elo rating over time.</p>
<h2 id="opponent-sampling-assumptions">Opponent Sampling
Assumptions</h2>
<p>Opponents faced by the player during the month are modeled
differently for league encounters and for the national tournament,
reflecting the institutional structure of Swiss table tennis.</p>
<h3 id="league-opponents-scheduled-clubs-roster-based-selection">League
opponents (scheduled clubs, roster-based selection)</h3>
<p>For league play, the opposing clubs are assumed to be known in
advance, as the season schedule is fixed at the beginning of the league.
For each of the two scheduled league encounters, the opponent faced by
the player is modeled as a random draw from the roster of the opposing
club.</p>
<p>To reflect selection patterns in team matches, the probability that a
given roster player is selected is assumed to be proportional to their
observed participation rate during the season (e.g., number of matches
played by that player divided by the total number of matches played by
the club).</p>
<h3 id="tournament-opponents-ab-pool-with-no-rematches">Tournament
opponents (A/B pool with no rematches)</h3>
<p>For the national tournament, eligible opponents are drawn from the
most recent Swiss ranking database, restricted to players belonging to
series A and B. This restriction reflects the fact that the player
participates only in tournaments whose relevant competitive pools are
typically within these series, and it ensures that the analysis remains
focused on ranking uncertainty at a sufficiently competitive level.</p>
<p>In the baseline model, opponents are sampled uniformly from the
eligible A/B pool. To preserve minimal tournament realism without
modeling a full bracket, we impose a <strong>no-rematch
constraint</strong>: once an opponent has been faced in the tournament,
they cannot be drawn again within the same tournament simulation. This
approximation captures the basic idea that tournament structures prevent
repeated matchups, while remaining computationally tractable.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="win-probability-models">Win Probability Models</h2>
<p>To simulate match outcomes within the Monte Carlo framework, the
model requires an estimate of the probability that the focal player wins
a given match against a specific opponent. Two alternative
win-probability models are considered: an Elo-based theoretical model
and a data-driven machine learning model. The purpose of this comparison
is not to assert the superiority of one model over the other, but to
assess how sensitive ranking uncertainty is to the choice of probability
estimator.</p>
<h3 id="elo-based-probability-model">Elo-Based Probability Model</h3>
<p>In the first approach, win probabilities are computed using the
official Swiss table tennis Elo formulation. Under this model, the
probability that player i defeats player j depends solely on the
difference between their Elo ratings and is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(i \text{ wins against } j) =
\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\frac{E_j - E_i}{200}}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E_j\)</span> denote the Elo ratings of players i
and j, respectively.</p>
<p>This formulation is directly embedded in the Swiss ranking system and
therefore serves as a natural theoretical benchmark. It assumes that the
Elo rating fully summarizes player strength and that match outcomes are
probabilistically determined by rating differences alone.</p>
<h3 id="machine-learning-probability-model">Machine Learning Probability
Model</h3>
<p>The second approach replaces the fixed Elo probability formula with a
data-driven probability estimator learned from historical match
data.</p>
<p>Rather than imposing a predefined functional relationship between Elo
differences and win probabilities, the machine learning model infers
this relationship empirically by observing past matches. Conceptually,
the model learns how often players with given Elo characteristics win or
lose and uses this information to estimate the probability of victory in
new, unseen matchups.</p>
<p>To avoid individual-specific overfitting and to ensure general
applicability, the machine learning model is trained on a dataset
comprising historical Swiss table tennis matches involving many players,
rather than only matches played by the focal player. The trained model
is subsequently applied to the focal player within the Monte Carlo
simulation.</p>
<h3 id="minimal-feature-specification">Minimal Feature
Specification</h3>
<p>In line with the objective of maintaining interpretability and
limiting data-engineering complexity, the machine learning model uses a
minimal feature set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elo rating of the focal player</li>
<li>Elo rating of the opponent</li>
</ul>
<p>No additional contextual variables (such as recent form, match
importance, or competition type) are included in the baseline
specification. This design choice ensures that the machine learning
model remains directly comparable to the Elo-based model, as both rely
on the same informational inputs.</p>
<h3 id="model-choice-and-interpretation">Model Choice and
Interpretation</h3>
<p>A <strong>logistic regression</strong> model is used as the baseline
machine learning classifier. This choice reflects a deliberate trade-off
between flexibility and transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logistic regression outputs well-calibrated probabilities.</li>
<li>Its structure closely mirrors the logistic form of the Elo model,
while allowing parameters to be estimated from data rather than fixed a
priori.</li>
<li>The resulting probability function can be interpreted as an
empirically estimated alternative to the Elo formula.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, the machine learning model is not assumed to outperform
the Elo-based model by construction. Its role is to provide an empirical
benchmark that captures observed match outcome frequencies in the
data.</p>
<h3 id="role-in-the-monte-carlo-simulation">Role in the Monte Carlo
Simulation</h3>
<p>Both probability models are embedded separately into the same Monte
Carlo simulation pipeline. All structural assumptions, opponent sampling
procedures, and Elo update rules are held constant. Any differences
observed in the resulting distributions of final Elo ratings can
therefore be attributed to differences in the underlying win-probability
models rather than to changes in simulation design.</p>
<h3 id="interpretation-scope">Interpretation Scope</h3>
<p>Differences between the Elo-based and ML-based simulations are
interpreted as reflecting <strong>model uncertainty</strong> in
probability estimation, not as definitive evidence of predictive
superiority. The comparison highlights how sensitive short-term ranking
uncertainty is to the assumptions embedded in probability modeling.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="elo-update-mechanism">Elo Update Mechanism</h2>
<p>After each simulated match, the player’s Elo rating is updated
according to the official Swiss table tennis Elo update rule. For a
given match, the Elo change is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta\text{Elo} = K \times
(\text{result} - P), \quad \text{result} \in \{1, 0\}\]</span></p>
<p>where: - <span class="math inline">\(K = 15\)</span> is the Elo
adjustment factor, - result equals 1 in case of a win and 0 in case of a
loss, - <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the official Elo-based
win probability implied by the Swiss ranking system.</p>
<p>The win probability <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is
computed using the fixed Elo ratings observed at the beginning of the
month:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = \frac{1}{1 +
10^{\frac{E_{\text{opp}} - E_{\text{player}}}{200}}}\]</span></p>
<p>Importantly, <strong>within a given month, Elo ratings are held
constant</strong>. All matches are played using the player’s Elo rating
at the beginning of the month, and Elo changes are computed
accordingly.</p>
<p>If the player participates in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
matches during the month, the total Elo change over the month is given
by the sum of individual match updates:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta\text{Elo}_{\text{month}} =
\sum_{m=1}^{M} \Delta\text{Elo}_m\]</span></p>
<p>The player’s Elo rating at the end of the month is therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Elo}_{\text{end}} =
\text{Elo}_{\text{start}} + \Delta\text{Elo}_{\text{month}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{Elo}_{\text{start}}\)</span>
denotes the Elo rating at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>In the Monte Carlo simulation, match outcomes are generated using
either the Elo-based probability model or the machine-learning-based
probability model described earlier. However, <strong>Elo point updates
always follow the official Swiss Elo update rule</strong>, ensuring that
simulated ranking changes remain fully consistent with the real-world
ranking system.</p>
<h2 id="monte-carlo-assumptions">Monte Carlo Assumptions</h2>
<p>Uncertainty in ranking evolution is modeled using Monte Carlo
simulation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The same month of competition is simulated repeatedly.</li>
<li>Each simulation uses independent random draws for opponent selection
and match outcomes.</li>
<li>The collection of final Elo ratings across simulations defines an
empirical distribution of ranking outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of simulations is chosen sufficiently large to ensure
stable estimates of distributional properties such as quantiles and
variance.</p>
<h2 id="simplifications-and-excluded-factors">Simplifications and
Excluded Factors</h2>
<p>Several real-world factors are intentionally excluded from the
model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical condition, fatigue, and injuries</li>
<li>Psychological effects</li>
<li>Strategic behavior and learning during tournaments</li>
<li>Long-term form dynamics</li>
</ul>
<p>These exclusions are motivated by data limitations and by the desire
to keep the model transparent and interpretable. Their potential impact
is discussed qualitatively in the limitations section.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation-framework">Interpretation Framework</h2>
<p>The resulting Elo distributions are interpreted as <strong>risk
profiles</strong>, analogous to return distributions in financial
modeling.</p>
<p>Differences between distributions obtained under different
probability models reflect model uncertainty rather than purely random
noise.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="methodology-conceptual-algorithm-without-code">Methodology
(Conceptual Algorithm Without Code)</h1>
<p>This section describes the simulation procedure used to generate the
distribution of end-of-month Elo ratings.</p>
<p>The methodology translates the modeling choices and hypotheses into a
precise algorithmic sequence, without introducing additional assumptions
or implementation-specific details.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-initialization">Step 1 – Initialization</h2>
<p>At the beginning of each simulation run:</p>
<ul>
<li>A focal player is defined with an initial Elo rating observed at the
start of the month.</li>
<li>This Elo rating remains fixed throughout the entire simulated month
and serves as the reference rating for all probability and Elo update
calculations.</li>
<li>All model parameters (competition structure, opponent pools,
probability model choice) are fixed and identical across simulation
runs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, all variability in simulated outcomes arises solely from
randomness in opponent selection and match outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-definition-of-the-competitive-month">Step 2 – Definition
of the Competitive Month</h2>
<p>Each simulation run represents one stylized month of competition.</p>
<p>The competitive month consists of a fixed sequence of matches,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>two league encounters, each composed of three individual matches,
and</li>
<li>one national tournament with a fixed total number of matches.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tournament structure is designed to guarantee a constant workload
across simulations and includes institutional constraints such as the
absence of rematches within the same tournament.</p>
<p>The player is assumed to participate in all scheduled matches.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-opponent-selection">Step 3 – Opponent Selection</h2>
<p>For each match in the simulated month, an opponent is selected
according to predefined rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>League matches</strong>: opponents are drawn from the
rosters of scheduled opposing clubs, with selection probabilities
reflecting observed participation frequencies.</li>
<li><strong>Tournament matches</strong>: opponents are sampled from an
eligible pool of A/B-ranked players, subject to a no-rematch constraint
within the tournament.</li>
</ul>
<p>Opponent Elo ratings are treated as known and fixed during the
month.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-win-probability-assignment">Step 4 – Win Probability
Assignment</h2>
<p>Once an opponent is selected, a probability of winning the match is
assigned.</p>
<p>Two alternative probability models are considered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elo-based probabilities</strong>, computed using the
official Swiss Elo formula and the fixed initial Elo rating.</li>
<li><strong>Machine-learning-based probabilities</strong>, estimated
from historical match data and applied using the same Elo inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, win probabilities depend on the fixed initial Elo
rating of the player and the opponent’s Elo rating.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-match-outcome-simulation">Step 5 – Match Outcome
Simulation</h2>
<p>Given the assigned win probability:</p>
<ul>
<li>The match outcome is simulated as a binary random variable (win or
loss).</li>
<li>Outcomes are generated using independent random draws across
matches, conditional on the assigned probabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>This step captures the intrinsic randomness of competitive match
outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="step-6-elo-update-calculation">Step 6 – Elo Update
Calculation</h2>
<p>After each simulated match:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Elo change is computed using the official Swiss Elo update
rule.</li>
<li>The expected score used in the update formula is always computed
using the player’s initial Elo rating and the opponent’s Elo
rating.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Elo changes are calculated at match level, these changes do
not affect subsequent match probabilities within the same month.</p>
<p>The total Elo change over the month is obtained by summing individual
match updates.</p>
<h2 id="step-7-end-of-month-elo-recording">Step 7 – End-of-Month Elo
Recording</h2>
<p>At the end of the simulated month:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player’s final Elo rating is computed as the initial Elo plus
the total accumulated Elo change.</li>
<li>This final Elo value represents one possible realization of the
month under the given probability model.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-8-monte-carlo-repetition">Step 8 – Monte Carlo
Repetition</h2>
<p>Steps 1–7 are repeated a large number of times.</p>
<p>Each repetition represents an alternative but plausible realization
of the same competitive month, differing only through random opponent
selection and match outcomes.</p>
<p>This procedure generates an <strong>empirical distribution</strong>
of end-of-month Elo ratings.</p>
<h2 id="step-9-aggregation-and-analysis">Step 9 – Aggregation and
Analysis</h2>
<p>From the simulated distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>summary statistics (mean, variance, quantiles) are computed,</li>
<li>distributional properties such as dispersion and tail behavior are
analyzed,</li>
<li>results are compared across probability models.</li>
</ul>
<p>No individual simulation run is interpreted as a prediction. Only
aggregate distributional features are used for interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="methodological-clarification">Methodological Clarification</h2>
<p>The simulation does not aim to predict future results. It addresses
the following counterfactual question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a fixed competitive month and fixed Elo reference ratings, how
much variability in end-of-month Elo outcomes arises purely from
randomness and probability modeling assumptions?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-this-methodology-is-consistent">Why This Methodology Is
Consistent</h2>
<ul>
<li>It respects the institutional rule that Elo ratings are updated only
after the month.</li>
<li>It ensures full comparability across probability models.</li>
<li>It provides a clean additive structure for interpreting Elo
risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="expected-results-and-interpretation">Expected Results and
Interpretation</h1>
<p>This section outlines the qualitative patterns and distributional
features that are expected to emerge from the Monte Carlo simulations,
prior to observing any numerical results. These expectations are derived
directly from the structure of the model, the competition format, and
the probabilistic assumptions described in the previous sections.</p>
<p>The purpose of this section is not to anticipate specific numerical
values, but to clarify the mechanisms through which uncertainty arises
and to define interpretable benchmarks for the subsequent empirical
results.</p>
<h2 id="expected-shape-of-the-elo-distribution">Expected Shape of the
Elo Distribution</h2>
<p>Given that the monthly Elo change is modeled as the sum of multiple
independent match-level updates, the distribution of end-of-month Elo
ratings is expected to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>approximately unimodal,</li>
<li>centered around a mean close to the expected Elo change implied by
the win probabilities,</li>
<li>with dispersion increasing as the number of matches increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, because individual match outcomes are binary and Elo updates
are asymmetric when win probabilities differ from 50%, the resulting
distribution may deviate from strict normality. In particular, mild
skewness may arise when the player is systematically favored or
unfavored against typical opponents.</p>
<h2
id="expected-role-of-match-volume-and-competition-structure">Expected
Role of Match Volume and Competition Structure</h2>
<p>The simulated month includes a relatively large number of matches,
combining league encounters and a tournament.</p>
<p>As a result:</p>
<ul>
<li>the variance of the monthly Elo change is expected to be
substantially larger than the variance of a single match outcome,</li>
<li>extreme positive or negative outcomes become plausible even if the
expected Elo change is moderate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tournament component, which introduces a broader and less
predictable opponent pool, is expected to contribute disproportionately
to the tails of the distribution, increasing both upside and downside
risk relative to league play alone.</p>
<h2 id="expected-impact-of-fixed-elo-within-the-month">Expected Impact
of Fixed Elo Within the Month</h2>
<p>Because the Elo rating is held fixed throughout the month:</p>
<ul>
<li>win probabilities do not adapt to interim success or failure,</li>
<li>early wins do not mechanically increase the probability of later
wins, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>This absence of intra-month feedback implies that the total Elo
change is an additive process driven by independent realizations.
Consequently, the distribution of outcomes reflects pure outcome
uncertainty rather than dynamic momentum effects.</p>
<p>This design choice is expected to yield cleaner and more
interpretable distributions, at the cost of ignoring short-term
psychological or form-related dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="expected-comparison-between-probability-models">Expected
Comparison Between Probability Models</h2>
<p>When comparing simulations based on the Elo-based probability model
and the machine-learning-based probability model, several qualitative
differences may emerge.</p>
<p>If both models produce similar average win probabilities across
matchups, the mean end-of-month Elo change is expected to be comparable.
However, differences may arise in higher-order distributional
properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>dispersion may differ if one model assigns more extreme
probabilities,</li>
<li>tail risk may increase if the machine learning model captures
nonlinearities or asymmetries not present in the Elo formula,</li>
<li>skewness may differ if one model systematically over- or
underestimates the player’s winning chances against specific opponent
segments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, any such differences are interpreted as reflecting
<strong>model uncertainty</strong> in probability estimation, not as
definitive evidence of predictive superiority.</p>
<h2 id="expected-sensitivity-to-opponent-sampling">Expected Sensitivity
to Opponent Sampling</h2>
<p>Because opponents are sampled probabilistically rather than
deterministically, the distribution of Elo outcomes is expected to be
sensitive to the realized mix of opponent strengths.</p>
<p>Simulations in which the player faces an unusually strong or weak set
of opponents are expected to populate the lower or upper tails of the
distribution, respectively. This mechanism highlights that ranking
uncertainty arises not only from match outcomes but also from the
stochastic nature of competition exposure.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation-framework-1">Interpretation Framework</h2>
<p>The simulated Elo distributions are interpreted as <strong>risk
profiles</strong>, analogous to return distributions in financial
contexts.</p>
<p>In this interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li>the mean Elo change represents expected performance,</li>
<li>the dispersion captures ranking volatility,</li>
<li>the lower tail reflects downside risk,</li>
<li>the upper tail reflects upside potential.</li>
</ul>
<p>The comparison across probability models therefore informs us how
sensitive perceived ranking risk is to modeling assumptions, rather than
providing a single forecasted outcome.</p>
<h2 id="role-of-this-section">Role of This Section</h2>
<p>This section establishes clear expectations against which the
empirical simulation results can be evaluated. Deviations between
observed results and these expectations will be interpreted as
informative signals about the interaction between competition structure,
probability modeling, and stochastic variability.</p>
