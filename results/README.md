# Results Directory

This directory contains output files generated by the simulation.

## Expected Files

After running `python main.py`, you will find:

- `elo_distribution.png` - Distribution of final Elo ratings and changes
- `elo_trajectories.png` - Sample Elo rating trajectories over the month
- `win_rate_vs_elo_change.png` - Relationship between win rate and Elo change
- `simulation_results.csv` - Raw simulation data for further analysis

## Regenerating Results

To regenerate all results:

```bash
python main.py
```

Results are reproducible due to fixed random seed (`random_state=42`).
